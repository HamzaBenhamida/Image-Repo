## How the application works:
The application uses **React** alongside **HTML**,**CSS** and **JavaScript** for the front-end and uses **Firebase** for the back-end. 

The application has been deployed using **Netlify** and can be accessed by entering: https://gallery-pictures.netlify.app (in your web browser)

Or you can aslo clone the code on your computer and in the project directory run:

```bash 
 npm install
 npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How to use the application:
The application is an image gallery which lets you add images (jpeg or png) to the gallery one by one by pressing the plus sign and selecting the chosen images. There is also the possibility to click on the images to see the enlarged version of the picture.

## Future Features:
-  Time was limited for this project and therefore unit testing was not fully implemented. Therefore next step would be to test all the components using **Jest**.
- Moreover, we would add the possibility for the user to add multiple images at a time.
- We could also make every user authenticate with google and see only his images. 
- Allowing the user to delete images is also crucial feature for the image repo.
- There is also a possibility for users to like other people's images which would make the web-app more interactive between users.
